In command line, simply input $javac *.java
After this is inputted, enter $java Planner

The first thing you should do after running the program and
entering the 3 prompts, is to go to the menu bar and select
“Load Courses” from the load option. Most things do not work
without courses.

The next recommended thing to do is choose a degree, however
it is not required. To choose a degree and major, from the home
screen click “Courses” and then “Select Degree/Major”.
To save the selected Degree, click “Degree” once you have
made your choice, and then Major once you have chosen your
Major.

The Required Courses page has a drop-down menu above the
load button and below the student info. I’m not sure why it
doesn’t show up, I have tried everything I can think of to make it
appear.
Options for this drop-down menu will only appear if a major is
chosen.
After choosing an option from the drop-down menu, click the
Load button to load all the prerequisites for that required
course.

If you click the “Maintain Courses” button, it will allow you to
choose whether you edit your transcript or Plan of Study. For
both options you can add or remove courses (which will be
displayed on the screen) and for the Transcript you can also edit
the grade (which is also displayed).
When entering a course code, be sure to include follow the
correct layout (ex. CIS*1500).

Selecting the Plan of Study option from the main menu brings
you to 3 options; Course Plan, Requirements and GPA.
If you select Course Plan, it will give you a drop-down menu
containing all the semesters of courses you have in your plan of
study. By pressing the load button at the bottom after making
your selection, it will load the courses for that semester.

By selecting GPA, a screen will come up and show you your
overall GPA, the GPA of your 10 most recent credits, and the
GPA of all CIS courses you have taken.

By selecting Requirements, it will display a bunch of stats such
as if the graduate requirements are met, how many credits you
have left in your transcript and plan of study, and your credits
completed.

There are also two buttons, the one on the left displays all the
required courses that have not yet been added to your plan of
study. The button on the right displays all of the required
courses that are not in your transcript.

To save your current progress, go to the save option in the
menu bar and click “Save Student”. This will create a file
FirstnameLastnameStudentnumber.txt

This makes the files of each student easier to find, as it just
corresponds to their full name and student number.

To save the current state of your courses, select the “Save
Courses” button under the “Save” menu option.

To create a new student, go to “New” in the menu bar and
select “New Student”. The interface will prompt you for the
user’s info.

To load a previously saved user, go to “load” in the menu bar
and select “Load student”. It will prompt you for a file name.
For the administrator window, you can either edit the degrees
or the courses.

When editing courses, all fields must be filled (exception of
Prerequisites which should be csv if any values are there) when
changing or adding courses. When removing a course all that is
needed is the course code.
